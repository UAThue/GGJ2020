  displayText: "A marauding band of gnolls is roaming the countryside and stealing
    our crops. We won\u2019t make it through the winter if they keep stealing our
    food at this rate. Also, they have an annoying laugh that is keeping people up
    at night, and making everyone in town a little cranky."
