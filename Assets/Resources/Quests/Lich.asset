  displayText: "Some floating skeletal looking lad has been doing some grave robbing.
    It doesn\u2019t seem interested in their treasures, but instead is taking the
    corpses. Poor grave digging Ernie tracked the monster to an abandoned nearby tower,
    and reported some strange glows and chanting coming from within. I don\u2019t
    know much, but that sounds like a quest if I\u2019ve ever heard one."
